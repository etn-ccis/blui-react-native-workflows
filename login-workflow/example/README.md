This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

This project now includes an Okta redirect login screen for authentication. To use the Okta redirect login screen, you need to configure your Okta application and update the environment variables in your project.

## Okta Configuration

1. Create an application in Okta.
2. Update the `.env` file in your project directory with the following variables:
    ```
    OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<your-okta-client-id>
    OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=<your-okta-redirect-uri>
    OKTA_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=<your-okta-logout-redirect-uri>
    OKTA_ISSUER=<your-okta-issuer-url>
    ```
3. Create an okta confg file and export it.
4. At OktaRedirectLoginScreen pass the okta config file in the prop 'oktaConfigObject'.
5. Access the signin status using EventEmitter provided by @okta/okta-react-native package by adding a listener 'signInSuccess'.

**Note: The Okta login screen will be automatically presented to the user if they are not authenticated. The user can log in using their Okta credentials. Once authenticated, they will be redirected to the Home screen.**


## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
